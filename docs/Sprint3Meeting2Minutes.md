### What I did last time
* Researched and added code pertaining to the our map fragment's activity lifecycle to ensure that the onRestart() method and not onDestroy() method is called when clicking the foreground notification button while the app is in the background.
### Problems
### What I will do next
* Continue testing different code in ForgroundService as well as the notification code.
## Eleanor
### What I did last time
* I changed the begin screen to constraint layout.
* I changed the parked screen to constraint layout.
* I re-ran all my test casses to make sure all buttons and view still worked and did a manual test as well.
### Problems
* I had some issues with constraint layout and the maps fragment but I got them to work together.
* I also had issues where the layout looked good on my phone but not on others, still doing testing on different devices.
### What I will do next
* Test on many devices to confirm the layout is correct
