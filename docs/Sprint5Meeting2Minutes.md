# Sprint 5 Meeting 2 Minutes
## Brian
### What I did last time
* Looked into Weather App API for local barometric pressure
### Problems
* Connection doesn't seem to be working right from the phone. Perhaps something with permissions or the http request.
### What I will do next
* Debug Weather API as a way to get the pressure to `SensorManager`.
## Drew
### What I did last time
* Looked into what to do to prepare for store listing (how it's presented in the Google Play store), AdMob, and other minor things involved with putting app in the store. 
### Problems
* Need to add a privacy policy, not quite sure how to go about this yet.
### What I will do next
* Look into what to do to make the correct sort of APK release.
## Eleanor

* Fixed the notifications.
### Problems
* Notifications were a pain but I got them to work.
### What I will do next
* Contiune to refactor code.
