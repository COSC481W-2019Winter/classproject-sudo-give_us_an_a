# Sprint 5 Meeting 2 Minutes
## Brian
### What I did last time
* Looked into Weather App API for local barometric pressure
### Problems
* Connection doesn't seem to be working right from the phone. Perhaps something with permissions or the http request.
### What I will do next
* Debug Weather API as a way to get the pressure to `SensorManager`.
## Drew
### What I did last time
* Looked into what to do to prepare for store listing (how it's presented in the Google Play store), AdMob, and other minor things involved with putting app in the store. 
### Problems
* Need to add a privacy policy, not quite sure how to go about this yet.
### What I will do next
* Look into what to do to make the correct sort of APK release.
## Eleanor
### What I did last time
* Fixed the notifications.
### Problems
* Notifications were a pain but I got them to work.
### What I will do next
* Contiune to refactor code.
## Lucas
### What I did last time
* Looked at potential solutions to implement elevation into the app using an external api or another service.
* Created a new branch to attemp getting the phones altitude from the phone using the sensorManager.
### Problems
* Using an api is still recomended for getting the pressure of the air at sea level to compare with the phone's sensor, but no attempt has fully worked yet.
### What I will do next
* See if I can improve the accuracy of the current elevation code to better represent the user's location over time.
