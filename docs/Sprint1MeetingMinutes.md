# Sprint 1 Meeting Minutes
## Brian
### What I did last time
* Finished 2.2 Metric Units
* Started working on 3. Navigation by testing speed
    * Found API level needs to be >=26 for good speed confidence
### Problems
* I had a debugging problem where I'm trying to overlay a debugging window over the app on the phone so that I could test the speed variables in real time. So far all debugging has been exclusive to Android Studio. I will probably use TextView to accomplish this.
### What I will do next
* Finish implementing speed
* Start and finish adding user settings configuation file
* Try to implement navigation
