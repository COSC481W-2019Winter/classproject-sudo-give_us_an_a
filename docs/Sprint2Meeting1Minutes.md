# Sprint 2 Meeting 1 Minutes
## Brian
### What I did last time
* Started 2.2 Metric Unit Tests
* Tried several different versions of Android OS for Text Formatting
### Problems
* It would appear that Google Play Services are necessary for ParkedUp, therefore KitKat would not be supported. Perhaps request a design change?
### What I will do next
* Finish 2.2 Unit Tests
* Complete Navigation
## Drew
### What I did last time
* Researched which way I should implement the app lasting after it is not the main focus
### Problems
### What I will do next
* Implement what I discover in order to solve this problem
## Eleanor
### What I did last time
* I changed the font and size styles.
* I seperated the about page.
### Problems
I still am figuring out saving and I discover the issue with returning. I didn't have access to the notifications code but Brian helped with that!
### What I will do next
* implement the if condition on notifiations
* figure out the save feature
* fix issue with returning from parked after going into settings.
