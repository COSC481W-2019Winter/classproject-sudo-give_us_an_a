## Lucas
### What I did last time
* Continued research and discussion about implementing elevation into the app.
### Problems
* Still looks like there is a challenge in getting data for altitude and barometric pressure for users.
### What I will do next
* Will look into implementing a file input for pressure constants above sea level and see if we can use that with sensor manager to give the user's altitude.
