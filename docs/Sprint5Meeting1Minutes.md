# Sprint 5 Meeting 1 Minutes
## Brian
### What I did last time
* Researched Elevation
### Problems
* The `SensorManager` needs the pressure at nearest airport. Need to calculate pressure based on altitude given in `.dat` file.
### What I will do next
* Implement pressure to altitude conversion
## Drew
### What I did last time
* Researched the correct steps to take to deploy app and insert adds
### Problems
* Using Admob for the adds, must make sure to use the sample add and not a real one so that I am not kicked off of the service
### What I will do next
* Further research into this topic into it's plausibility
## Eleanor
### What I did last time
* I have done all refactoring and clean up of code except for classes that may be deleted in the process of fixing notification.
### Problems
* I am trying to figure out why notifications are not appearing, still haven't found anything.
### What I will do next
* Continue to figure out why the notifications won't work
## Lucas
### What I did last time
* Continued research and discussion about implementing elevation into the app.
### Problems
* Still looks like there is a challenge in getting data for altitude and barometric pressure for users.
### What I will do next
* Will look into implementing a file input for pressure constants above sea level and see if we can use that with sensor manager to give the user's altitude.
