 # Communication Guidelines
 
 Our team will use our slack channel (sudoa.slack) to check in with one another, ask questions and share advice. 
 Our current setup for our slack has a general, project, random, api_key and sha-1_certificate channel. With each channel having a specific
 purpose it allows us to sperate and keep organized. We have utilized the pinning feature to mark information that is very important.
