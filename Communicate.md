# Communication Guidelines
 
Our team will use our slack channel (SudoA.slack) to check in with one another, ask questions and share advice.

Our current setup for our slack has a general, project, random, api\_key and sha-1\_certificate channel. With each channel having a specific purpose it allows us to separate and keep organized. We have utilized the pinning feature to mark information that is very important.

We also use Github with GitExtentions for git to push our work which keeps the team updated on project progress.
